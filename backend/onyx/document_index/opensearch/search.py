        https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/query-dsl/compound/hybrid/

        NOTE: Each query is independent during the search phase, there is no backfilling of scores for missing query components.
        What this means is that if a document was a good vector match but did not show up for keyword, it gets a score of 0 for
        the keyword component of the hybrid scoring. This is not as bad as just disregarding a score though as there is
        normalization applied after. So really it is "increasing" the missing score compared to if it was included and the range
        was renormalized. This does however mean that between docs that have high scores for say the vector field, the keyword
        scores between them are completely ignored unless they also showed up in the keyword query as a reasonably high match.
        TLDR, this is a bit of unique funky behavior but it seems ok.

        NOTE: Options considered and rejected:
        - minimum_should_match: Since it's hybrid search and users often provide semantic queries, there is often a lot of terms,
          and very low number of meaningful keywords (and a low ratio of keywords).
        - fuzziness AUTO: typo tolerance (0/1/2 edit distance by term length). This is reasonable but in reality seeing the
          user usage patterns, this is not very common and people tend to not be confused when a miss happens for this reason.
          In testing datasets, this makes recall slightly worse.

        The "filter" key applies a logical AND operator to its elements, so

        retrieved. This function returns a list of such subfilters.
        See https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/query-dsl/compound/bool/

        Args:
            tenant_state: Tenant state containing the tenant ID.
            include_hidden: Whether to include hidden documents.
            access_control_list: Access control list for the documents to
                retrieve. If None, there is no restriction on the documents that
                can be retrieved. If not None, only public documents can be
                retrieved, or non-public documents where at least one acl
                provided here is present in the document's acl list.
            source_types: If supplied, only documents of one of these source
                types will be retrieved.
            tags: If supplied, only documents with an entry in their metadata
                list corresponding to a tag will be retrieved.
            document_sets: If supplied, only documents with at least one
                document set ID from this list will be retrieved.
            user_file_ids: If supplied, only document IDs in this list will be
                retrieved.
            project_id: If not None, only documents with this project ID in user
                projects will be retrieved.
            time_cutoff: Time cutoff for the documents to retrieve. If not None,
                Documents which were last updated before this date will not be
                returned. For documents which do not have a value for their last
                updated time, we assume some default age of
                ASSUMED_DOCUMENT_AGE_DAYS for when the document was last
                updated.
            min_chunk_index: The minimum chunk index to retrieve, inclusive. If
                None, no minimum chunk index will be applied.
            max_chunk_index: The maximum chunk index to retrieve, inclusive. If
                None, no maximum chunk index will be applied.
            max_chunk_size: The type of chunk to retrieve, specified by the
                maximum number of tokens it can hold. If None, no filter will be
                applied for this. Defaults to None.
                NOTE: See DocumentChunk.max_chunk_size.
            document_id: The document ID to retrieve. If None, no filter will be
                applied for this. Defaults to None.
                WARNING: This filters on the same property as user_file_ids.
                Although it would never make sense to supply both, note that if
                user_file_ids is supplied and does not contain document_id, no
                matches will be retrieved.
            attached_document_ids: Document IDs explicitly attached to the
                assistant. If provided along with hierarchy_node_ids, documents
                matching EITHER criteria will be retrieved (OR logic).
            hierarchy_node_ids: Hierarchy node IDs (folders/spaces) attached to
                the assistant. Matches chunks where ancestor_hierarchy_node_ids
                contains any of these values.

        Returns:
            A list of filters to be passed into the "filter" key of a search
