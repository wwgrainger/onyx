"""Tests for OpenSearch assistant knowledge filter construction.

These tests verify that when an assistant (persona) has user files attached,
the search filter includes those user file IDs in the assistant knowledge filter
with OR logic (not AND), ensuring user files are discoverable alongside other
knowledge types like attached documents and hierarchy nodes.

This prevents a regression where user_file_ids were added as a separate AND
filter, making it impossible to find user files when the assistant also had
attached documents or hierarchy nodes (since no document could match both).
